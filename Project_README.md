The city of Newark, NJ has compiled a list of multiple abandoned and vacant buildings.  From this list, our goal was to find a correlation between this list and the factors that may have contributed to the number of abandoned properties. The overall data on city statistics of housing demographics, crime, education, and poverty were obtained and evaluated.

In this project we all have studied the different factors which can affect the housing and abandoned property increases decrease in the city of Newark, NJ.

Every team member has worked on different dataset inputs, but there have been instances where the output was joined with other inputs to form a more meaningful dataset. The data joining was done either on Zipcode basis or on City level where zip codes are not avaiable. 

Below are the different areas we focused on for the study of data of Newark city.

1. 01_Newark Overall Housing Data:  This study covers the demographics of Newark city for 2019. The Housing Occupancy details for 5 years. Study of  Geographical mobility in past 5 years for the city of Newark and the property values estimates of NJ State to Newark. 

2. 02_Abandoned Housing: This study is more focussed on the houses that are abandoned in Newark. The data available is more specific and zip code based which gives a good picture of which zip code has the most of the abandoned housing.

3. 03_Poverty_Rate_Data_Analysis: This study is focussed on poverty rates for all zipcodes in Newark. The data of abandoned housing was combined here with the poverty rate data to fine a corelation between the poverty rates and the abandoned housesfor zipcodes. 

4. 04_Education: This analysis is focussed on the working on the High school and the college data in Newark. A study was done to see the if education taken was affected in Newark over years. This data study is for years from  2014-2019

5. 05_Crime_Data_Study: This part of the project covers the crime rate in Newark, different types of crimes observed in Newark for years 2018-2019.

From the different factors we have tried to find if there exists any relationship between various factors which affect the  abandoning/over all housing in Newark. 

Every folder has its own data folder and its output folder. The output folder contains the CSVs, PNG files and individual analysis.

Below are few analysis we could make out from the overall project,

      Gradual decrease was observed in overall housing units from 2015-2019.

      07103 contains the highest percentage of abandoned properties.

      Zip codes with highest poverty rates: 07108, 07103, and 07102.

      There exists a relation between property rate to the abandoned houses rate for zipcode 07103

      Essex County College, Newark, NJ had the highest withdrawal rate from 2014-2019 for the data collected during this timeframe. High School suspension rate for 2016-2017 could have an impact on the college drop out rate for the same time frame.

      Crime rate in Newark was seen to be high in 2018 and the owner- occupied  housing units went down in 2018.  We observed an increase in owner occupied units in 2019 and at the same time showed a decrease in crime rate.

Plots:
Different Plots such as pie charts, line chart, 2- axis line chart, bar plots, grouped bar plots, gmaps have been used to describe the data 
and the findings.


Data Limitations : All data found was not exactly zipcode specific so we have rolled up the data to city level.
Data was not avaiable for all years for all above factors, some had only 2019-2020 others had more wide range data avaiable, so for few factors one to one relationship/ observations could not be drawn.
Some data files were huge in Education folder, so we had to add link to the URL could not post the actual data files to the folder
